## Acknowledgements

Please note that due to the purpose of this project, as well as limitations and/or development constraints, **this project IS NOT a final product Application**. 

It serves merely as a prototype, implementing in-memory storage to simulate database interactions, large codebase to simulate most of the features, and complemented with a lightweight JavaFX UI Design.
## Local Installation

To install this project for demonstration purposes, simply clone/download the repositories completely, and launch the JavaFX Application Interface through the `StayChecked-Launcher.bat`

## Application
